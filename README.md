Solidity Lottery Smart Contract
Overview
This GitHub repository contains the source code for a simple decentralized lottery smart contract developed in Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain. This lottery contract allows participants to enter the lottery by sending a specified amount of Ether. The contract manager can then randomly select a winner who receives the entire prize pool.

Features
Decentralized Lottery: Utilizes the Ethereum blockchain for transparency and trustlessness.
Participant Entry: Users can participate in the lottery by sending Ether to the contract.
Random Winner Selection: The winner is selected randomly from the list of participants.
Prize Distribution: The contract manager distributes the entire prize pool to the winner.
